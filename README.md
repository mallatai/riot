Early prototype of what is supposed to be a game about crowd control in a riotous city.

Planned mechanics include:
- restricting crowds to a bounded areas and keeping them peaceful
- deploying police units to contain crowds in a certain areas and to cut crowds into parts for snatching
- deploying fences, specialized vehicles
- simulation of effects of various lethal and non-lethal ammunition, such as tear gas, pepper spray

Story goes as follows:
- you play as a beginning police officer under the dictator's rule
- gradually you can use more advanced and violent tools for crowd control of a rioters in a city
- if you are able to stop riot, you get a medal from a vicious ruler
- if revolution wins, you stand trial and pay for your atrocities (if such had been committed)
